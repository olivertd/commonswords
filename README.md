# Language Learning: Common Words Dataset

This repository provides JSON files containing the most frequently used words in different languages. These lists are designed for developers and language learners who want to integrate high-frequency vocabulary into their applications or study tools.

### Available Languages
- **Spanish (250 words)**  
  *(More languages and larger datasets will be added over time)*

## Purpose

Mastering a language starts with learning its most common words. This dataset offers a progressive approach to language learning by focusing on core vocabulary:

1. **Start with 250 words**
2. **Expand to 500 words**
3. **Eventually learn 1000 words and beyond**

This method allows users to quickly form basic sentences and start using the language, improving grammar and sentence structure over time.

## How to Use

The JSON files contain the most common words, but you'll need to write code to effectively utilize them. These files can be integrated into language learning apps, NLP models, or personal study tools. One example of how this dataset is used can be found at [talcoth.com/commonwords](https://talcoth.com/commonwords), where the Spanish 250 dataset is implemented.

## Roadmap

Planned updates include:
- Adding new languages
- Expanding word lists to 500, 1000, and beyond
